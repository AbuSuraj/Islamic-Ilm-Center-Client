              No matter what your personal style is, we want you to feel comfortable at the Islamic Center. We do not have a specific dress code. We ask visitors to respect this as a place of worship and dress modestly. Women are not required to cover their hair to enter or participate in our Center, but we do request headscarves be worn in the prayer hall and during prayer out of reverence for our tradition. We have a small number of scarves available for guests at the front of the women’s prayer section.

              We love babies and children at the Islamic Center! We also love having a safe and comfortable worship space for all of our visitors. There are several kid-friendly areas at the Center, so there is no need to miss a program or service if your child gets fussy. Some of our programs, such as Friday prayer service, often feature live audio streaming making it easy to listen from the comfort of your home when you can’t make it in person. During Ramadan, fundraisers and other special events, we typically provide free childcare. When in doubt, please give us a call to find out at 213.382.9200.
